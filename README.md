# Food Truck Project
This is a program designed to take information from a user and maintain a record of information about different Food Trucks. The information can include their name, popular menu items, and their overall rating so the user can compare them with one another.
# Technologies Used
 -Static versus non-Static
 -Loops
 -Constructors
 -Arrays
# Lessons Learned
I created this program to display my ability to bring together user information and Arrays to make a useful application for anyone interested in comparing their experience with different Food Trucks and keeping track of their information.
